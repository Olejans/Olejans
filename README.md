# Greetings, Colleague!

Welcome to this README file, my name's Oleg!

Had a weird story with all my programming career, so i'll try to summarize it a bit:

- Had HTML and CSS experience by summer IT-camp in Ukraine ["STEP Academy"](https://itstep.zp.ua/) (Turn translator on unless you know ukrainian)
- Studying for Computer Engineer in college (WIP);
- Worked with Java via [Processing programm](https://processing.org/) (Had a group work at the end! I was programming a Tic-Tac-Toe part of the game. If the file is still alive, i can perhaps put it on repository!);
- Studied C and C++ for... quarter of study year (Not enough, i know);
- Studying Python in a [Pragmatic Industries company](https://pragmaticindustries.com/en/) (WIP)

About me:

- As time have shown - I always come to meeting places earlier with extra time <i>(to waste time watching memes).</i>
    - Resisting phone addiction (Although i don't think it won't be normal for next adult generation T_T)
- Developing equanimity.
    - Very tolerant because of this, but don't expect me to be amused with differences you decided to add to your personality.
- <b>"Progress won't await."</b>
- Dreaming of becoming a Game Designer with a trusty team to create a fascinating abstract game.
    - Drawing stuff traditionally (Had tried Digital as well, and i even want to start doing digitally. I don't know why i'm hesitant, my guess is that i'm lacking the opportunity)
- [Spanish Tortilla](https://foodnetwork.co.uk/recipes/spanish-tortilla) is the best potato dish along with [Draniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake). <u><b>Prove me wrong.</b></u>
- Not very social in real life
    - A Textrovert (I'm more active in online-chats)

That's all i remembered for now!
